# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project creates a Python-based automated solution that generates randomized, synthetic test data based on a provided Trivy JSON vulnerability report. The tool addresses the challenge of testing security scan data ingestion systems by providing realistic, diverse test datasets while maintaining the original JSON schema structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide a single example Trivy JSON file and have a script generate multiple randomized versions of it, so I can test my data ingestion pipeline with a variety of realistic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid Trivy JSON file as input THEN the system SHALL accept and parse the file successfully
2. WHEN the system processes the input file THEN it SHALL maintain the original JSON schema structure
3. WHEN generating randomized versions THEN the system SHALL create unique variations that preserve the data format
4. WHEN the generation process completes THEN the system SHALL output multiple distinct JSON files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to specify the number of randomized files to generate, so I can create a large test dataset for performance and load testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies the number of files to generate THEN the system SHALL accept this as a configurable parameter
2. WHEN the parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL generate exactly that number of unique files
3. WHEN generating 1,000 files THEN the system SHALL complete the process in under 30 seconds on standard development hardware
4. WHEN no number is specified THEN the system SHALL use a sensible default value (10 files)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the randomized data to maintain the original JSON schema, so my analysis scripts do not require refactoring to work with the new data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates randomized files THEN each file SHALL maintain the exact same JSON schema as the input
2. WHEN preserving structure THEN the system SHALL keep all nested objects and arrays in their original positions
3. WHEN randomizing data THEN the system SHALL only modify field values, not field names or structure
4. WHEN validating output THEN each generated file SHALL be valid JSON that matches the Trivy schema

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to randomize specific vulnerability fields realistically, so the test data accurately represents real-world security scan scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN randomizing root-level fields THEN the system SHALL modify ArtifactName, ImageID, and OwnerEmailAddress with realistic values
2. WHEN processing vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL randomize VulnerabilityID using valid CVE format (CVE-YYYY-XXXXX)
3. WHEN updating package information THEN the system SHALL select PkgName from a predefined list of common Linux packages
4. WHEN setting versions THEN the system SHALL generate realistic InstalledVersion and FixedVersion strings
5. WHEN assigning severity THEN the system SHALL randomly select from valid severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, UNKNOWN)
6. WHEN calculating CVSS scores THEN the system SHALL generate realistic V2Score and V3Score float values within valid ranges
7. WHEN setting dates THEN the system SHALL randomize PublishedDate and LastModifiedDate with valid datetime strings
8. WHEN setting the number of Vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL randomize the number of vulnerabilities present from 0 to 20

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command-line interface, so I can easily integrate the tool into my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the script THEN the system SHALL accept command-line arguments for input file and output count
2. WHEN executed with minimal parameters THEN the system SHALL provide clear usage instructions
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display progress and completion status
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and exit codes
5. WHEN the script is executed THEN it SHALL support standard CLI patterns (--help, --version flags)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want well-structured, documented code, so the tool can be easily extended to support other security scanner formats in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have modular, well-organized functions
2. WHEN examining the code THEN each function SHALL have clear documentation and type hints
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the architecture SHALL support extension to other scanner formats
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive unit test coverage
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging
