# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project creates a Python-based automated solution that generates randomized, synthetic test data based on a provided Grype JSON vulnerability report. The tool addresses the challenge of testing security scan data ingestion systems by providing realistic, diverse test datasets while maintaining the original JSON schema structure. Grype uses a different schema format than Trivy, with matches-based vulnerability reporting that includes detailed artifact information and match details.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide a single example Grype JSON file and have a script generate multiple randomized versions of it, so I can test my data ingestion pipeline with a variety of realistic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid Grype JSON file as input THEN the system SHALL accept and parse the file successfully
2. WHEN the system processes the input file THEN it SHALL maintain the original JSON schema structure including matches array format
3. WHEN generating randomized versions THEN the system SHALL create unique variations that preserve the Grype-specific data format
4. WHEN the generation process completes THEN the system SHALL output multiple distinct JSON files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to specify the number of randomized files to generate, so I can create a large test dataset for performance and load testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies the number of files to generate THEN the system SHALL accept this as a configurable parameter
2. WHEN the parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL generate exactly that number of unique files
3. WHEN generating 1,000 files THEN the system SHALL complete the process in under 30 seconds on standard development hardware
4. WHEN no number is specified THEN the system SHALL use a sensible default value (10 files)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the randomized data to maintain the original JSON schema, so my analysis scripts do not require refactoring to work with the new data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates randomized files THEN each file SHALL maintain the exact same JSON schema as the input
2. WHEN preserving structure THEN the system SHALL keep all nested objects and arrays in their original positions
3. WHEN randomizing data THEN the system SHALL only modify field values, not field names or structure
4. WHEN validating output THEN each generated file SHALL be valid JSON that matches the Grype schema

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to randomize specific vulnerability fields realistically, so the test data accurately represents real-world security scan scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN randomizing vulnerability data THEN the system SHALL modify vulnerability.id using valid CVE format (CVE-YYYY-XXXXX)
2. WHEN updating vulnerability severity THEN the system SHALL randomly select from valid severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Negligible, Unknown)
3. WHEN setting CVSS scores THEN the system SHALL generate realistic baseScore, exploitabilityScore, and impactScore values within valid ranges (0.0-10.0)
4. WHEN randomizing EPSS data THEN the system SHALL generate realistic epss scores (0.0-1.0) and percentile values (0.0-1.0)
5. WHEN updating fix information THEN the system SHALL generate realistic version strings and fix states (fixed, not-fixed, wont-fix, unknown)
6. WHEN setting dates THEN the system SHALL randomize date fields with valid ISO date strings
7. WHEN modifying artifact data THEN the system SHALL randomize artifact.name, artifact.version, and artifact.id with realistic values
8. WHEN updating package URLs THEN the system SHALL generate valid PURL (Package URL) format strings
9. WHEN setting the number of matches THEN the system SHALL randomize the number of vulnerability matches from 1 to 50

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the tool to randomize match details and related vulnerabilities, so I can test complex vulnerability correlation scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing match details THEN the system SHALL randomize matcher types (apk-matcher, java-matcher, etc.)
2. WHEN updating search criteria THEN the system SHALL modify distro information and package details realistically
3. WHEN randomizing related vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL generate varied numbers of related CVEs (0-5 per match)
4. WHEN setting vulnerability descriptions THEN the system SHALL use realistic security vulnerability descriptions
5. WHEN updating data sources THEN the system SHALL randomize dataSource URLs while maintaining valid URL format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command-line interface, so I can easily integrate the tool into my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the script THEN the system SHALL accept command-line arguments for input file and output count
2. WHEN executed with minimal parameters THEN the system SHALL provide clear usage instructions
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display progress and completion status
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and exit codes
5. WHEN the script is executed THEN it SHALL support standard CLI patterns (--help, --version flags)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want well-structured, documented code, so the tool can be easily extended and maintained alongside the existing Trivy generator.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have modular, well-organized functions
2. WHEN examining the code THEN each function SHALL have clear documentation and type hints
3. WHEN integrating with existing tools THEN the architecture SHALL be consistent with the Trivy generator approach
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive unit test coverage
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging
6. WHEN extending functionality THEN the code SHALL support easy addition of new randomization strategies
