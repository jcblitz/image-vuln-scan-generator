## 1. Problem Statement

Testing systems that ingest and process security scan data, such as the output from Trivy, is a significant challenge. Developers and quality assurance teams require a large volume of realistic, yet non-production, test data to ensure their downstream pipelines are robust and can handle various vulnerability report scenarios. Manually creating this data is time-consuming and prone to human error, often failing to capture the diversity and scale of real-world reports. The lack of varied test data can lead to undiscovered bugs, poor performance, and a brittle system.

## 2. Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a Python-based, automated solution that generates randomized, synthetic test data based on a provided Trivy JSON vulnerability report. The generated data will maintain the schema of the original report while randomizing key fields to simulate a diverse set of real-world scenarios.

## 3. User Stories / Requirements

* **As a developer,** I want to provide a single, example Trivy JSON file and have a script generate multiple randomized versions of it, so I can test my data ingestion pipeline with a variety of realistic data.  
* **As a QA engineer,** I want to specify the number of randomized files to generate, so I can create a large test dataset for performance and load testing.  
* **As a data scientist,** I want the randomized data to maintain the original JSON schema, so my analysis scripts do not require refactoring to work with the new data.

## 4. Technical Requirements

The solution will be a Python script that accepts an input JSON file and a number of files to generate.

* **Input**: A single, valid Trivy JSON file (e.g., golang-1.12-alpine.json).  
* **Output**: A directory containing N number of unique, randomized Trivy JSON files, where N is a configurable parameter.  
* **Randomization Logic**:  
  * **Root-level fields**: The script must randomize ArtifactName and ImageID.  
  * **Vulnerabilities array**: The script must iterate through the Vulnerabilities array within the Results section. For each vulnerability object, the following fields must be randomized:  
    * VulnerabilityID: Generate unique, realistic-looking CVEs (e.g., CVE-YYYY-XXXXX).  
    * PkgName: Select from a predefined list of common Linux packages (e.g., busybox, apk-tools, openssl).  
    * InstalledVersion and FixedVersion: Generate random version strings.  
    * Severity: Randomly select from a list of severity levels (e.g., CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, UNKNOWN).  
    * CVSS scores: Randomize the V2Score and V3Score with realistic float values.  
    * PublishedDate and LastModifiedDate: Randomize the date/time strings.  
  * **Structure Preservation**: The script must ensure that the nested structure of the JSON object, including the Metadata, Results, and Vulnerabilities arrays, remains consistent with the original schema.

## 5. Success Metrics

* **Functionality**: The script successfully generates unique JSON files that are validated against the Trivy schema.  
* **Usability**: The script is easy to run from the command line with a clear, minimal set of parameters.  
* **Performance**: The script can generate 1,000 randomized files in under 30 seconds on standard development hardware.  
* **Maintainability**: The codebase is well-documented and modular, allowing for easy expansion to support other security scanner formats in the future.
